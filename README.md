🌟 HEALTH ISSUE PREDICTION APP 🩺

💡 An AI-powered Streamlit application that predicts potential health risks based on your lifestyle and vitals.








🧠 Overview

The Health Issue Prediction App is a machine learning–based tool that helps users analyze their health using common vitals and daily habits.
By entering data such as age, BMI, cholesterol, glucose level, and exercise frequency, the app predicts possible health conditions like Diabetes, Heart Disease, or Liver Problems.

It uses a trained Random Forest Classifier and a StandardScaler for accurate and consistent predictions — all wrapped in a clean, interactive Streamlit UI.

🚀 Features

✅ Predicts multiple health risks with ML accuracy
✅ Accepts real-world lifestyle and medical inputs
✅ Uses feature scaling for consistent results
✅ Displays prediction confidence percentages
✅ Simple, responsive, and elegant Streamlit design
